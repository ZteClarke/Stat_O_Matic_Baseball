In this project, I explore and analyze Major League Baseball teams' stats from 1990 through 2021. 

The dataset I used Sean Lahman’s baseball archive. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics

The original dataset contained 2985 rows and 47 columns.

I decided to focus my project on the exploration of which variable was most important for wins. This culminated in a machine learning model the predicted division and world series winners. 

The following questions lead my analysis: 
•	What team had the most wins in a single season?
•	What team had the most losses in a single season?
•	Which franchises had the most wins from 1990 to 2021? 
•	Which franchises had the most losses from 1990 to 2021? 
•	Which variables affect winning? 
 

This project was completed using SQL, Python, and PowerPoint.
